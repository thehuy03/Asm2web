        <h3>10 questions in the script that need to be answered in Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
        <p>Like many other Marvel movies, Chekov realized that Spider-Man: No Way Home also had plot holes, leaving big questions. After the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home, Peter Parker's identity was made public and that caused him, as well as friends and family, to suffer a lot of injustice.</p>

            The web-slinging superhero turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help, but in the process of reciting the spell to make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, something went wrong that caused the universes to collide. Villains from multiple universes invade the main timeline. Let's take a look at 10 questions about plot holes with Chekov that the audience painfully answered!
        </p>
        <h5>78 / 5,000
            How can the Multiverse revive villains that have "faded color"? 
        </h5>

        <p>Doctor Strange's magic disrupted the multiverse, drawing those who knew Peter Parker's identity to the main timeline. But most of the villains that appear are already "disappeared" in their own world, it is unclear how the multiverse can revive these guys.</p>

        <p>Chekov thinks that the other worlds' timelines work differently, the events of Spider-Man 2 could have just happened, and that's why Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) has absolutely no memory of being sold. salt. On the contrary, it is possible that due to the overpowering spell, the villains were pulled out of their timeline just before "returning to the West". As Doctor Strange puts it, the multiverse is something very little known about, so the rules (and all the inconsistencies in the timeline) are still a mystery and need to be solved by Marvel.</p>

        <h5>Why is no one investigating Quentin Beck/Mysterio?</h5>
        <p>With all of the allegations against Peter in Spider-Man: No Way Home, no one should be surprised or question Quentin Beck's actions or learn he was a fired Stark Industries employee.</p>
        <img src="https://static1.dienanh.net/upload/202112/74e4bea1-14be-49a4-9cd8-b8282af15847.jpeg" alt="">
        <h5>How did Aunt May & Happy meet if not through Peter Parker?</h5>
        <p>If Peter Parker's secret identity is not known, it is possible that Happy and Aunt May met under other circumstances, such as working for a nonprofit organization that helped Aunt May work with Stark Industries and then met Happy. .</p>
        <br>
        <p>Either way, the scenario implies that the past has somehow changed to fit the void in people's memories since Peter Parker was resurrected.</p>

        <h5>How does Electro know Peter Parker is Spider-Man?</h5>
        <p>Electro died in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and never got a chance to find out Spider-Man's true identity. Spider-Man: No Way Home also reaffirms the fact that the villain doesn't know Peter's identity - when Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man takes off his mask, Electro is surprised that the superhero is a young man and jokes when think Peter is black.</p>

        <p>As a result, Chekov found it strange that Electro was being dragged through the multiverse. Maybe Electro absorbed too much energy right before "fading" in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, somehow remembering Peter's name.</p>
        <h5>How does Venom know Peter Parker is Spider-Man?</h5>
        <img src="https://static1.dienanh.net/upload/202112/e3bc2013-033b-4408-bcfe-9de015eb91a4.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>
            After the events of Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage, there is no indication that Venom knows who Spider-Man is and has apparently never heard of Peter Parker. This talkative symbiote is quite confused by the multiverse and struggles to understand Thanos and the snap before being transported back to his own world. 
        </p>
        <h5>How does Doc Ock know the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn?</h5>
        <p>When Spider-Man mentioned the Green Goblin, Doc Ock explained that the Green Goblin had been gone for many years. However, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy never confirmed the public had known Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin.</p>
        <img src="https://static1.dienanh.net/upload/202112/7fa9b58e-934f-4000-9410-7720462b5db6.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Dr. Otto Octavius was a former Oscorp employee and knew Harry, Osborn's son, with no explanation as to why he knew Norman was the Green Goblin. Did Doc Ock accidentally learned the information while working at Oscorp and kept it a secret out of respect for Harry. Either way, this question remains unanswered in Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p>
