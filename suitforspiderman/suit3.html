        <h3>A special Spidey suit based off the appearance of the character in the Spider-Man Noir comic series.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Unlocks the 'Sound of Silence' skill, which means that enemies no longer call for backup once they're alerted. Shhh...</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Available for crafting unlock from the very start.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>By default, the Noir Suit features the Sound of Silence stealth ability, which allows Spider-Man to prohibit enemies from calling for assistance. With the ability active, enemies radioing to their friends will find no help coming, and with Spider-Man's attacks being silenced, he is able to fight as loud as he wants and other enemies cannot detect him except by line of sight.</h3>
