        <h3>At one point in Marvel History, Peter loses his Spider sense - and that leaves him very vulnerable to bullets. He created this armor to be more survivable.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Appropriately this armor comes with the 'Bullet Proof' armor skill, where the armor plating of the suit can be used to make the suit bullet-proof against all enemies - even sniper shots.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Available at Level 5, and costs 1 Base Token, 1 Landmark Token and 2 Research Tokens to craft.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Enhanced Durability: The suit has shown to be able to withstand a direct impact from a grenade launcher without any obvious harm coming to the wearer. It is also fully capable of deflecting multiple bullets, though Spider-Man expressed discomfort in being hit.    </h3>
