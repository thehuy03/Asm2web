        <h3>Worn by Spider-Man during the much-loved Secret War phase of the comics - and let's be fair, this suit looks amazing.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Unlocks the 'Arms Race' suit ability. This discharges an amplified EMP build-up which then stuns enemies and disables their weapons.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Available from level 7 and up. The Secret War suit costs 2 Backpack Tokens, 1 Base Token and 2 Research Tokens to unlock.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>The associated Arms Race suit power allows Spider-Man to detonate a blast around him that can hit a wide range of attackers on all sides, and will stun nearby enemies, while rendering guns useless for a short while, letting Spider-Man attack without fear of ranged weapons.</h3>
